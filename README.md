# Jacobs-Thrift-Viewer
UNFINISHED JS OOP PROJECT! my first attempt at a good looking and responsive front end exsperience. Communicates with 3 diffrent API to let the user filter and search clothes to add to their 'want cart'

this was mostly just to get good at Figma and animations, so I'm not too ashamed to admit all the features that need to be created

1) Query Search without filter 
2) Query Search with input from filters (check api for what filters are allowed avaliable)
3) Want cart item adding and caching with local storage

PS. I got to the point of getting all my Api's to make a deafult search and cache all the data in local storage.
Everytime it loads, granted there's enough products, it should load them instead of fetching a bunch of new results and using API tokens.

Here is the APIs I used. Please make your own account for keys!!
